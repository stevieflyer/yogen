uh scared of", "start": 314.759, "duration": 4.921}, {"text": "global functions to begin with but as", "start": 317.58, "duration": 3.78}, {"text": "you get started with the riverpod you", "start": 319.68, "duration": 4.799}, {"text": "know that riverpot manages the uh memory", "start": 321.36, "duration": 5.279}, {"text": "uh state for you as well and also all", "start": 324.479, "duration": 3.421}, {"text": "the resources so you don't have to worry", "start": 326.639, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "that oh I have a global function here", "start": 327.9, "duration": 3.239}, {"text": "what's

these as we go", "start": 333.06, "duration": 4.68}, {"text": "on with the course", "start": 335.88, "duration": 3.36}, {"text": "so", "start": 337.74, "duration": 3.54}, {"text": "um when you create providers with", "start": 339.24, "duration": 4.14}, {"text": "riverpot you also need to have something", "start": 341.28, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "called a provider scope so the provider", "start": 343.38, "duration": 4.319}, {"text": "scope is", "start": 346.08, "duration": 4.86}, {"text": "um is kind of an object that will allow", "start": 347.699, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "you to work with providers because as I", "start": 350.94, "duration": 4.68}, {"text": "mentioned providers are like Global", "start": 353.759, "duration": 4.021}, {"text": "functions and flutter doesn't know", "start": 355.62, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "anything really about those global", "start": 357.78, "duration": 3.479}, {"text": "functions so", "start": 359.58, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "um this provider scope which is kind of", "start": 361.259, "duration": 4.321}, {"text": "like a magical object that we'll use", "start": 363.84, "duration": 4.04}, {"text": "soon as you'll see in our applications", "start": 365.58, "duration": 5.82}, {"text": "it is a glue that brings provider to the", "start": 367.88, "duration": 6.52}, {"text": "flutter world so you will see in the", "start": 371.4, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "first example how we're going to use it", "start": 374.4, "duration": 2.639}, {"text": "so don't worry about it for now but if", "start": 375.72, "duration": 2.88}, {"text": "you see it just know that it is like a", "start": 377.039, "duration": 4.041}, {"text": "bridge between River pod and", "start": 378.6, "duration": 5.34}, {"text": "flutter so", "start": 381.08, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "um as I mentioned and we're gonna get", "start": 383.94, "duration": 4.259}, {"text": "started I think we're going to develop", "start": 386.52, "duration": 5.1},

the testes", "start": 403.319, "duration": 5.701}, {"text": "how to test how to work with provider", "start": 405.72, "duration": 7.14}, {"text": "and sorry with um riverpod and providers", "start": 409.02, "duration": 6.239}, {"text": "as these six examples are gonna get", "start": 412.86, "duration": 4.679}, {"text": "completed then we're gonna go into doing", "start": 415.259, "duration": 7.081}, {"text": "a full-fledged instabac sorry Instagram", "start": 417.539, "duration": 7.38}, {"text": "um clone instabug is also a product just", "start": 422.34, "duration": 3.78}, {"text": "so
